                When did you start solving the Rubik's Cube?
            </p>
            <p class="faqa">
                I can't remember for certain, but I think it was around july 2012. From that time on I have played with the the cube on and off.
            </p>
            <p class="faqq">
                Have you participated in any competition/tournament?
            </p>
            <p class="faqa">
                No, I have not. <br> Even though there might be some events in Vienna I could attend, I do not feel confident enough to participate. Even if my record of 15.56 seconds looks great, other people have an average solving-time around 10-13
                seconds compared to my average of 25 seconds.
            </p>
            <p class="faqq">
                Do you have more than 1 Rubik's Cube?
            </p>
            <p class="faqa">
                I have 2 Rubik's Cubes that belong to me. My brother and my sister do have their own cubes and we have another one in our living room that belongs to everyone I guess. Even though one Rubik's Cube would be enough for me, I have one with me when I go to
                school or take the train. That way I don't have to take it out of my backpack all the time if I want to play at home.
            </p>
            <p class="faqq">
                Are you actively practicing in order to get better?
            </p>
            <p class="faqa">
                Not anymore. At first when I got the cube, I played a lot with it and learned by solving it all the time. But after some time when it gets more complicated you have to work on certain algorithms over and over again to get faster.
            </p>
            <p class="faqq">
                Why is it recommended to start solving the white side first, and not for example the blue side?
            </p>
            <p class="faqa">
                I think the reason behind this are some tournament rules. The Rubik's Cube will always be revealed to you with the yellow side on the top. That makes it more convenient for people as they do not have to rotate the cube at the start because advanced solvers
                almost always have the yellow side on top during their solve.
                <br> But that being said, professional speedcubers can and will solve the cube starting with other sides as well, if the scrambled cube favours a certain color.
