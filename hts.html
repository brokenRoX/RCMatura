                For solving the Rubik's Cube there are simple steps you can follow. This is one of many methods on how to solve the Rubik's Cube, and if you can remember this algorithm by heart you can try to get faster and faster until you reach a solving-time around
                1 minute. At that point I'd look for additional guides on how to solve it faster. Until then, complete the Rubik's Cube over and over again.

                The first task will be, to get aquainted with the Rubik's Cube. This is one of the most important steps for solving the cube. After that you'll be solving the cube step by steps in that order:

            <ol>
                <li>Create the white cross</li>
                <li>Complete a full white area</li>
                <li>Insert side edges</li>
                <li>Create the yellow cross</li>
                <li>Complete a full yellow area</li>
                <li>Match the corner pieces</li>
                <li>Match the edge pieces</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                All these steps are explained in the video below.
