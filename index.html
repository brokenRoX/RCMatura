           Welcome to my Rubik's Cube!
        </h1>
        <p>
            The intent behind this website is to help you solve the Rubik's cube and show you, that it's not as hard as you might have believed it to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though there are many different cubes you could try and solve, we will be focusing on the 3x3x3 cube, which is the best cube to start with, in my opinion, and the method with which you can solve the 3x3x3 cube can be partially applied to some other
            cubes as well.
        </p>
        <div class="pg">
            <img src="cube.svg" alt="Rubik's Cube" class="cube" /> On the right side you can see how a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube looks like.
            <br><br> If you haven't got one by now, you probably should, so that we can figure out how to solve a scrambled one.

            You can either jump right ahead to the part where you can solve the Rubik's Cube by clicking either <strong><a href="hts.html">here</a></strong> or by using the navigation on top of this website.
            <br> Or you can also just continue reading for a minute, and I'll explain why I'm quite fascinated by the Rubik's Cube.

          How I started
        </h1>
        <p>
            My first Rubik's Cube was given to me by one of my cousins. My cousin himself was enjoying the process of learning how to solve the Rubik's Cube and thought that I might enjoy it just as much. So I was given a Rubik's Cube which cost him about <b>8â‚¬</b>            I guess. The cubes in that price range are already pretty decent and can be used to achieve good solving times.
            <br> At first I looked at guides on how to solve it and got a little bit of personal teaching through my cousin.
            <br> After some time I learned to solve the Rubik's Cube by heart. So I hade no need for the basic guide anymore. It took me around 1 Minute and 30 seconds to solve the Rubik's Cube in an average, but my cousin was way faster than I was, so
            I asked how he'd get solving times of just 50 seconds. He told me that there is the basic guide on how to solve a Rubik's Cube, but if you want to get faster solving it, you have to look at certain shortcuts and different moves.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned a lot of those shortcuts and moves and I probably have an average solving time of just <em><strong>25 seconds</strong></em> right now, with my best time being <em><strong>15,56 seconds</strong></em>.
            <br><br> My introduction on solving the cube will be only the easy method, with that method you won't have to remember just as much as I do right now.
            <br> Don't get discouraged if it's a lot for the beginning. Just look at it step by step, it'll probably take you some time to remember it.
            <br> Once you can solve the Rubik's Cube in about 1 minute using this method, you might want to look further into guides where you find different moves and shortcuts.
